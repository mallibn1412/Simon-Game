# Simon-Game
Front-end game project

This is as similar as Simon game - The memory Game
It uses javascript to make array of gamePattern and userPattern 
Upon every click it can be made to play the sound,
and checks at every instant that the userPattern is similar to user pattern or not : 
if yes the game continues to next level
else the game ends
